#+title: Run OpenGenera in Docker
#+author: 凉凉
* Usage
1. you should have the access to Open Genera =sys.sct=, which is kinda
   illegal but fine to get from internet ([[https://archives.loomcom.com/genera/var_lib_symbolics.tar.gz][here]] and [[https://archive.org/details/OpenGenera][here]])
2. clone this repo and run =make build= will build a docker image for genera
3. use =make run= to start the genera

Current Issue:
+ I cannot figure out how to set NFS server in Docker, it just raise
  error of: =/ does not support NFS export=, so you may need open a
  NFS server in your host machine
