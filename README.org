#+title: Run OpenGenera in Docker
#+author: 凉凉
* Usage
1. you should have the access to Open Genera =sys.sct=, which is kinda
   illegal but fine to get from internet ([[https://archives.loomcom.com/genera/var_lib_symbolics.tar.gz][here]] and [[https://archive.org/details/OpenGenera][here]])

   if you can just clone this repo
2. clone this repo and run =make build= will build a docker image for genera
   (the docker image is named as =genera=)
3. use =make run= to start the genera

   if you are using macOS with XQuartz, you may need run
   =xhost +127.0.0.1= first
4. [Optional] login, define your site, edit host, and save world ([[https://archives.loomcom.com/genera/genera-install.html][see this]])

   *WHY OPTIONAL*: here has two World: =distribution.vlod= (got from [[http://www.jachemich.de/vlm/genera.html][here]])
   and =World.vlod= (I set up the site =genera-docker= and set the login
   user =LISP-MACHINE= with correct RPC-GID and RPC-UID, ref: [[https://symbolics.lisp.engineer/genera-8-3-setup-part-2/][lisp.engineer]]).
   By default, the docker image is built for using with =World.vlod=.
   You don't need to do all the setup things if you just accept my
   configuration. (although it is recommanded to do your own config)

   you may need to patch the xlib (maybe see [[https://github.com/LispEngineer/genera-src/blob/master/x11/xlib-patch.lisp][here]] or [[https://archives.loomcom.com/genera/genera-install.html#org13acdb2][here]]) if you are using
   =symbolics/World.vlod= (default, which is got from [[http://www.jachemich.de/vlm/genera.html][here]], with NFSv3 patch,
   but somehow I have to patch when using with [[https://github.com/li-yiyang/qemu-opengenera][vncserver]], while not in docker)
5. do some fun stuffs, the key map is shown below ([[https://archives.loomcom.com/genera/genera-install.html#org209a9d3][original]]):

   note: possibly, can refer [[https://symbolics.lisp.engineer/p/729ba25c-f091-4404-aa6e-4b9247c1f1c8/][here]] for patching; or just use
   Karabiner or else to modify the key

Issues:
+ you may need create =rel-8-*= (for example, =rel-8-6=) manually
  if you cannot load system

  #+begin_src shell
    make bash # switch to docker bash
    mkdir /var/lib/symbolics/rel-8-6 # your rel path
    ln -s /var/lib/symbolics/sys.sct /var/lib/symbolics/rel-8-6/sys.sct
  #+end_src

  *TIP*: if you just use =World.vlod=, I just done it for you
  in =Dockerfile= when building the image.
+ some file seemed to be missing? or the NFS server cannot read
  (thought it was due to the NFSv3's fault, but no lucky setting up
  a NFSv2 server in docker)
